Excellent! I have everything I need! Let me start building your ultimate AI companion! ðŸš€
Action: Let me create a comprehensive plan for this AI companion app:

**ARCHITECTURE PLAN:**

**Backend (FastAPI):**
1. API Routes:
   - /api/chat - Main conversation endpoint (GPT-4o)
   - /api/voice/transcribe - Speech-to-text (Whisper)
   - /api/voice/speak - Text-to-speech (OpenAI TTS)
   - /api/image/generate - Image generation (DALL-E 3)
   - /api/document/analyze - Document analysis (GPT-4o Vision)
   - /api/research - Web search (Perplexity + Tavily)
   - /api/code - Code generation/analysis
   - /api/marketing - Marketing materials generation
   - /api/settings/keys - API key management
   - /api/conversations - Conversation history

2. MongoDB Collections:
   - conversations (user messages, AI responses, timestamps)
   - user_settings (API keys, preferences, AI name)
   - documents (cached documents, PDFs)
   - tasks (scheduled tasks, reminders)

**Frontend (Expo):**
1. Core Screens:
   - Home/Chat - Main conversation interface
   - Voice Mode - Voice-only interaction
   - Settings - API key management, preferences
   - History - Past conversations
   - Tools - Quick access to features (image gen, docs, research)
   - Onboarding - First conversation for name selection

2. Features:
   - Voice input (expo-av for recording)
   - Text input with rich formatting
   - Real-time streaming responses
   - Offline mode with cached content
   - Push notifications for tasks
   - Share sheet integration
   - Beautiful, thumb-friendly UI

**Implementation Strategy:**
Phase 1: Core chat with voice (text + audio I/O)
Phase 2: Document analysis & image generation
Phase 3: Web research & coding features
Phase 4: Marketing tools & advanced features
Phase 5: iOS integrations & polish

Let me start building!
